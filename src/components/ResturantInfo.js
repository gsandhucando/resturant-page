        <span className='first-letter'>Langbaan</span> is an intimate 24 seat restaurant located behind a bookcase
        inside of Paadee, a casual Thai restaurant focusing on regional Issan
        cuisine. The name Langbaan comes from the Thai word for “back of the
        house,” the area in a Thai home where the kitchen and dining room are
        located, the area where meals are both prepared and lovingly eaten with
        family and friends.

      <p>
        <span className='first-letter'>Here</span> at Langbaan, inspired by the warm and convivial atmosphere of Thai
        kitchens, we transform classic Thai food into a refined multi-course
        tasting menu using the bounty of Pacific Northwest ingredients. We pride
        ourselves in providing a unique Thai-style dining experience inspired by
        century-old traditions here in Portland, Oregon.
