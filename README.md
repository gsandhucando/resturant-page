I used react to create the front end of an existing restaurant and rebuild it with a couple different things that I think looks better also I added a database so you can submit your email in the footer. When not it mobile view you can see how I used a modal from material-ui and the calendar from simple react calendar, you can also reserve a data which gets put into the data base.
