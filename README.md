I redid an existing restaurant site with my own design. In the footer you can submit an email address and it gets added to the database. I created a photo carousel with an image animation that only happens when the site renders and disappears when clicking to the next image. When clicking reservations not in mobile view I create a model that has a calendar and dropdown menus that get added to a database. In team I only created a model for the first team member just to show the ability to do so. In mobile view I created a hamburger menu that has a slight fade in transition.

Thanks,
